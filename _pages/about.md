About Me
------
I'm going to be a PhD student in MechE at University of Michigan advised by [Prof. Viswanathan](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/venkatv/index.html). Earlier, I received M.S. in Computational Materials Science and Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and did research in [Mechanical and AI Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/barati) advised by [Prof. Farimani](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/barati-farimani-amir.html). Besides, I received B.Eng in Materials Science and Engineering at South China University of Technology.

My research interest lies in combining Artificial Intelligence with interdisciplinary science and engineering problems. My current research focuses on implementing and improving deep learning in molecular property prediction and conformation generation to understand complex chemical systems. I believe that deep learning models are able to learn representations from data so that we can understand scientific problems from a data science view, which is a significant transformation to traditional research strategies.
