About Me
------
I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at University of Michigan, working on Molecular Machine Learning in [EEG](https://eeg.engin.umich.edu/) advised by [Prof. Viswanathan](https://aero.engin.umich.edu/people/viswanathan-venkat/). Earlier, I received M.S. in Computational Materials Science and Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and did research in [Mechanical and AI Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/barati) advised by [Prof. Barati Farimani](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/barati-farimani-amir.html). Besides, I received B.Eng in Materials Science and Engineering at South China University of Technology.

My research interest lies in combining Artificial Intelligence with interdisciplinary science and engineering problems. My current research focuses on implementing and improving foundation models for material discovery and leveraging scientific machine learning for electrolyte optimization. I believe that deep learning models are able to learn representations from data so that we can understand scientific problems from a data science view, which is a significant transformation from traditional research strategies.
