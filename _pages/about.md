I'm a graduate student in [Mechanical and AI Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/barati) at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interest lies in combining Artificial Intelligence with interdisciplinary science and engineering problems. My current research focuses on implementing and improving deep learning in molecular property prediction and conformation generation to understand complex chemical systems. I believe that deep learning models are able to learn representations from data so that we can understand scientific problems from a data science view, which is a significant transformation to traditional research strategies.
